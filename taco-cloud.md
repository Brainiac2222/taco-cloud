## About The Project
Taco Cloud is a hands-on learning project designed to showcase a modern Java web application stack. It simulates an online taco shop where authenticated users can select from a list of fresh ingredients, design their own unique tacos, and place an order.

The application handles everything from user registration and login to data persistence and form validation, providing a complete, end-to-end user experience.

## Key Features
- User Authentication: Secure registration and login functionality powered by Spring Security.
- Dynamic Taco Creation: A user-friendly form to design tacos by selecting ingredients.
- Order Management: A shopping cart and order form with validation for user details.
- Data Persistence: User data, ingredients, and orders are stored in a database via Spring Data JPA.
- RESTful Endpoints: A well-defined API for managing ingredients and taco designs.
